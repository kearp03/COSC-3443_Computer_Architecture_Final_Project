# COSC-3443 Computer Architecture Final Project
Source code for the COSC 3443 Computer Architecture Final Project. Taken Fall 2023 at Tarleton State University. The goal of this project is to impliment a function that operates on arrays in Assembly. The different Phases are highlighted below.

## Contents

- Phase 1: Proposal for the project
- Phase 2: Basic x86-64 Assembly Programming: Impliment first version
- Phase 3: Advanced Assembly Implementation: Copy of Phase 2 with expanded size of inputs, used to compare timings with the two optimizations
- Phase 3 Optimization 1: First Optimization Pass: Loop unrolling
- Phase 3 Optimization 2: Second Optimization Pass: Loop unrolling and function inlining

All projects are built using MASM and Visual Studio 2022.
